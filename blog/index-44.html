<p>The PyPy team is proud to release version 7.3.15 of PyPy.</p>
<p>This is primarily a bug-fix release, and includes work done to migrate PyPy to
Git and Github.</p>
<p>The release includes three different interpreters:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>PyPy2.7, which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
Python 2.7 including the stdlib for CPython 2.7.18+ (the <code class="docutils literal">+</code> is for
backported security updates)</p></li>
<li><p>PyPy3.9, which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
Python 3.9, including the stdlib for CPython 3.9.18.</p></li>
<li><p>PyPy3.10, which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
Python 3.10, including the stdlib for CPython 3.10.13.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The interpreters are based on much the same codebase, thus the multiple
release. This is a micro release, all APIs are compatible with the other 7.3
releases. It follows after 7.3.14 release on Dec 25, 2023</p>
<p>We recommend updating. You can find links to download the v7.3.15 releases here:</p>

<p>We would like to thank our donors for the continued support of the PyPy
project. If PyPy is not quite good enough for your needs, we are available for
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.pypy.org/pypy-sponsors.html">direct consulting</a> work. If PyPy is helping you out, we would love to hear about
it and encourage submissions to our <a class="reference external" href="https://pypy.org/blog">blog</a> via a pull request
to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pypy/pypy.org">https://github.com/pypy/pypy.org</a></p>
<p>We would also like to thank our contributors and encourage new people to join
the project. PyPy has many layers and we need help with all of them: bug fixes,
<a class="reference external" href="../posts/2024/01/index.html">PyPy</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://rpython.readthedocs.org">RPython</a> documentation improvements, or general <a class="reference external" href="../posts/2024/01/project-ideas.html">help</a> with
making RPython's JIT even better.</p>
<p>If you are a python library maintainer and use C-extensions, please consider

<section id="what-is-pypy"><h3>What is PyPy?</h3>
<p>PyPy is a Python interpreter, a drop-in replacement for CPython
It's fast (<a class="reference external" href="https://speed.pypy.org">PyPy and CPython 3.7.4</a> performance
comparison) due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler.</p>
<p>We also welcome developers of other <a class="reference external" href="https://rpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html">dynamic languages</a> to see what RPython
can do for them.</p>
<p>We provide binary builds for:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>x86</strong> machines on most common operating systems
(Linux 32/64 bits, Mac OS 64 bits, Windows 64 bits)</p></li>
<li><p>64-bit <strong>ARM</strong> machines running Linux (<code class="docutils literal">aarch64</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>Apple <strong>M1 arm64</strong> machines (<code class="docutils literal">macos_arm64</code>).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>s390x</strong> running Linux</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>PyPy support Windows 32-bit, Linux PPC64 big- and little-endian, and Linux ARM
32 bit, but does not release binaries. Please reach out to us if you wish to
sponsor binary releases for those platforms. Downstream packagers provide
binary builds for debian, Fedora, conda, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Gentoo, and more.</p>

    <p>PyPy has moved its canonical repo and issue tracker from
<a href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy">https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy</a> to <a href="https://github.com/pypy/pypy">https://github.com/pypy/pypy</a>. Obviously,
this means development will now be tracked in Git rather than Mercurial.</p>
<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
<p>We still feel Mercurial is a better version control system. The named branch
model and user interface are superior. But</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>foss.heptapod.net is not well indexed in google/bing/duckduckgo
  search, so people find it harder to search for issues in the project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since Heptapod has tightened its spam control, we get reports that
  users create issues only to have them flagged as spam.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open Source has become synonymous with GitHub, and we are too small to
  change that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Much of the current development comes as a reaction to fixing issues.
  Tracking interlocking issues is easier if all the code is on the same
  platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/faq.html#why-doesn-t-pypy-use-git-and-move-to-github">FAQ</a>
  presents two arguments against the move. <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-notes">Github notes</a>
  solves much of point (1): the difficulty of discovering provenance of
  commits, although not entirely. But the main problem is point (2), it turns
  out that <strong>not</strong> moving to GitHub is an impediment to contribution and issue
  reporting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People who wish to continue to use Mercurial can use the same method below to
  push to GitHub.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GitHub is more resource rich than foss.heptapod.net. We could add CI
  jobs to replace some of our aging <a href="https://buildbot.pypy.org">buildbot
  infrastructure</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="method">Method</h3>
<p>The migration required two parts: migrating the code and then migrating the
issues and merge requests.</p>
<h4 id="code-migration-1-code-and-notes">Code migration 1: code and notes</h4>
<p>I used a <a href="https://github.com/mnauw/git-remote-hg">fork of git-remote-hg</a> to
create a local Git repo with all the changesets. Then I wanted to add a Git
note to each commit with the branch it came from. So I prepared a file with two
columns: the Git commit hash, and the corresponding branch from Mercurial.
Mercurial can describe each commit in two ways: either the commit hash or by a
number index. I used <code>hg log</code> to convert an index <code>i</code> to the Mercurial hash,
and then <code>git-hg-helper</code> from <code>git-remote-hg</code> to convert the Mercurial hash to
a Git hash:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">$(cd pypy-git; git-hg-helper git-rev $(cd ../pypy-hg; hg log -r $i -T"{node}\n"))
</pre></div>

<p>Then I used <code>hg log</code> again to print the Mercurial branch for the index <code>i</code>:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">$(cd pypy-hg; hg log -r $i -T'{branch}\n')
</pre></div>

<p>Putting these two together, I could loop over all the commits by their
numerical index to prepare the file. Then I iterated over each line in the
file, and added the Git note. Since the <code>git note add</code> command works on the
current HEAD, I needed to checkout each commit in turn and then add the note:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">git checkout -q &lt;hash&gt; &amp;&amp; git notes --ref refs/notes/branch add -m branch:&lt;branch&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>I could then use <code>git push --all</code> to push to GitHub.</p>
<h4 id="code-migration-2-prepare-the-branches">Code migration 2: prepare the branches</h4>
<p>PyPy has almost 500 open branches. The code migration created all the branch
HEADs, but <code>git push --all</code> did not push them. I needed to check them out and
push each one. So I created a file with all the branch names</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">cd pypy-hg; hg branches | cut -f1 -d" " &gt; branches.txt
</pre></div>

<p>and then push each one to the GitHub repo</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">while</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">read</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">branch</span><span class="c1">; do git checkout branches/$branch &amp;&amp; git push origin branches/$branch; done &lt; branches.txt</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Note that the branches were named <code>branches/XXX</code> by the migration, not <code>branch/XXX</code>. This confuses the merge request migration, more about that later.</p>
<h4 id="issue-and-merge-request-migration">Issue and merge request migration</h4>
<p>I used the solution from
<a href="https://github.com/piceaTech/node-gitlab-2-github">node-gitlab-2-github</a> which
worked almost perfectly. It is important to do the conversion on a <strong>private
repo</strong> otherwise every mention of a successfully mapped user name notifies
the user about the transfer. This can be quite annoying for a repo the size of
PyPy with 600 merge requests and over 4000 issues. Issues transferred without a
problem: the script properly retained the issue numbers. However the script
does not convert the Mercurial hashes to Git hashes, so the bare hashes in
comments show up without a link to the commit. Merge requests are more of a problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Mercurial named branch "disappears" once it is merged, so a merge request
  to a merged branch does not find the target branch name in Git. The
  conversion creates an issue instead with the label <code>gitlab merge request</code>.</li>
<li>For some reason, the branches created by <code>git-remote-hg</code> are called
  <code>branches/XXX</code> and not <code>branch/XXX</code> as expected by GitLab. This messes up the
  merge request/PR conversion. For some of the branches (open PRs and main
  target branches) I manually created additional branches without the <code>es</code>. The
  net result is that open merge requests became open PRs, merged merge requests
  became issues, and closed-not-merged merge requests were not migrated.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="layered-conversions">Layered conversions</h4>
<p>PyPy already migrated once from Bitbucket to Heptapod. Many of the issues
reflect the multiple transitions: they have lines like "Created originally on
Bitbucket by XXX" from the first transition, and an additional line "In
Heptapod" from this transition.</p>
<h3 id="credits">Credits</h3>
<p>We would like to express our gratitude to the <a href="https://octobus.net/">Octobus</a>
team who support Heptapod. The transition from Bitbucket was quite an effort,
and they have generously hosted our development since then. We wish them all
the best, and still believe that Mercurial should have "won".</p>
<h3 id="next-steps">Next steps</h3>
<p>While the repo at GitHub is live, there are still a few more things we need to
do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Documentation needs an update for the new repo and the build automation from
  readthedocs must be adjusted.</li>
<li>The wiki should be copied from Heptapod.</li>
<li>buildbot.pypy.org should also look at the new repo. I hope the code is up to
  the task of interacting with a Git repo.</li>
<li>speed.pypy.org tracks changes, it too needs to reference the new location</li>
<li>To keep tracking branches with Git notes on new commits, I activated a
  <a href="https://github.com/Julian/named-branch-action">github action</a> by Julian to
  add a Git branch note to each commit. Please see the README there for
  directions on using Git notes.</li>
<li>Some of the merge requests were not migrated. If someone wants to, they could
  migrate those once they figure out the branch naming problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, now is the time for all of you to prove the move is worthwhile:</p>
<ul>
<li>Star the repo, let others know how to find it,</li>
<li>Help fix some of the open issues or file new ones,</li>
<li>Take advantage of the more familiar workflow to get involved in the project,</li>
<li>Suggest ways to improve the migration: are there things I missed or could
  have done better?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-will-development-change">How will development change?</h3>
<p>Heptapod did not allow personal forks, so we were generous with a commit bit to
the main repo. Additionally, we (well, me) have been using a
commit-directly-to-main workflow. We will now be adopting a more structured
workflow. Please fork the repo and submit a pull request for any changes. We
can now add some pre-merge CI to check that the PR at least passes the first
stage of translation. The live and active branches will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>main</code>: what was "default" in Mercurial, it is the Python2.7 interpreter and
  the base of the RPython interpreter,</li>
<li>
<code>py3.9</code>: the Python3.9 interpreter, which also includes all RPython changes
  from <code>main</code>. This is exactly like on Mercurial, and</li>
<li>
<code>py3.10</code>: the Python3.10 interpreter, which also includes all RPython changes
  from <code>main</code> and all bugfixes from <code>py3.9</code>. This is exactly like on Mercurial.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="working-between-the-repos">Working between the repos</h4>
<h5 id="finding-commits">Finding commits</h5>
<p>If you want to figure out how a Mercurial commit relates to a Git commit, you
can use <code>git-hg-helper</code>. You run it in the Git repo. It takes the full long
hash from one repo and gives you the corresponding hash of the other repo:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">$<span class="w"> </span>git-hg-helper<span class="w"> </span>git-rev<span class="w"> </span>d64027c4c2b903403ceeef2c301f5132454491df
4527e62ad94b0e940a5b0f9f20d29428672f93f7
$<span class="w"> </span>git-hg-helper<span class="w"> </span>hg-rev<span class="w"> </span>4527e62ad94b0e940a5b0f9f20d29428672f93f7
d64027c4c2b903403ceeef2c301f5132454491df
</pre></div>

<h5 id="finding-branches">Finding branches</h5>
<p>Branches migrated from Mercurial will have a <code>branches</code> prefix, not <code>branch</code>.
While GitLab uses <code>branch</code> for its prefix, the <code>git-remote-hg</code> script uses
<code>branches</code>. New work should be in a PR targeting <code>main</code>, <code>py3.9</code> or <code>py3.10</code>.</p>
<p>Thanks for helping to make PyPy better.</p>

<h2 id="update">Update</h2>
<p>In the meantime we found out that unfortunately something went wrong in the
migration of the issues. The old <a href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/issues/3655">issue
3655</a> got lost in the
migration. This means that after number 3655 the numbers are different between
github and heptapod, with heptapod being one larger. E.g. <a href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/issues/3700">issue 3700 on
heptapod</a> is <a href="https://github.com/pypy/pypy/issues/3699">issue 3699 on
github</a>. We are <a href="https://github.com/pypy/pypy/issues/4979">investigating
options</a>. </p>

<p>The PyPy team is proud to release version 7.3.14 of PyPy.</p>
<p>Highlights of this release are compatibility with <a class="reference external" href="https://hpyproject.org/blog/posts/2023/10/hpy-0.9.0-fourth-public-release/">HPy-0.9</a>, cffi 1.16,
additional C-API interfaces, and more python3.10 fixes.</p>
<p>The release includes three different interpreters:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>PyPy2.7, which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
Python 2.7 including the stdlib for CPython 2.7.18+ (the <code class="docutils literal">+</code> is for
backported security updates)</p></li>
<li><p>PyPy3.9, which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
Python 3.9, including the stdlib for CPython 3.9.18.</p></li>
<li><p>PyPy3.10, which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
Python 3.10, including the stdlib for CPython 3.10.13.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The interpreters are based on much the same codebase, thus the multiple
release. This is a micro release, all APIs are compatible with the other 7.3
releases. It follows after 7.3.13 release on Sept 29, 2023.</p>
<p>We recommend updating. You can find links to download the v7.3.14 releases here:</p>

<p>We would like to thank our donors for the continued support of the PyPy
project. If PyPy is not quite good enough for your needs, we are available for

<p>We would also like to thank our contributors and encourage new people to join
the project. Since the last release we have contributions from three new
contributors.  PyPy has many layers and we need help with all of them: bug
fixes, <a class="reference external" href="../posts/2023/12/index.html">PyPy</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://rpython.readthedocs.org">RPython</a> documentation improvements, or general <a class="reference external" href="../posts/2023/12/project-ideas.html">help</a>

<p>The PyPy team is proud to release version 7.3.13 of PyPy.
This is primarily a security/bug-fix release. CPython released security
patches, and this release also improves the ability to use type
specifications via <code class="docutils literal">PyType_FromSpec</code> and friends. There are also some
small speed-ups.</p>
<p>The release includes three different interpreters:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>PyPy2.7, which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
Python 2.7 including the stdlib for CPython 2.7.18+ (the <code class="docutils literal">+</code> is for
backported security updates)</p></li>
<li><p>PyPy3.9, which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
Python 3.9, including the stdlib for CPython 3.9.18.</p></li>
<li><p>PyPy3.10, which is an interpreter supporting the syntax and the features of
Python 3.10, including the stdlib for CPython 3.10.13. Note it requires at
least cython 0.29.35 or cython 3.0.0b3.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The interpreters are based on much the same codebase, thus the multiple
release. This is a micro release, all APIs are compatible with the other 7.3
releases. It follows after 7.3.12 release on June 16, 2023.</p>
